# automotiveapi
Test API for Detroit Labs using Swagger2 for API specification

# Build and run
Use Maven to build and generate sources. I have set the API to run on port 9999 which can be changed in the application properties 
YAML file.

# Web UI
The generated Swagger2 API specification can be viewed at http://localhost:9999/swagger-ui.html once the app has been started via Spring Boot
